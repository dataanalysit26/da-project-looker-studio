# 📈 Digital Campaign Performance Analysis (Facebook & Google)

## ✨ Project Overview & Description

This project involves the creation of an interactive dashboard comparing campaign metrics derived from Facebook and Google media sources. Our goal is to enable data-driven decisions by analyzing the performance of the two different platforms using key metrics.

## 💾 Data Source

A non-public dataset provided by the institution where I received my training was utilized. This dataset includes metrics such as ad spend, revenue, and core performance indicators.

## 🔑 Key Findings

The analysis includes comparisons of campaign performance based on total spend, total revenue, CPC (Cost Per Click), CPM (Cost Per Mille/Thousand), CTR (Click-Through Rate), and **ROMI (Return on Marketing Investment)** across monthly and yearly periods.

According to the performance evaluation:

### Year-over-Year Efficiency Analysis
* **Efficiency Constraint:** Although total expenditure increased significantly between 2021 and 2022, the overall **ROMI value remained nearly constant**. This indicates that the increase in budget and the corresponding rise in the number of campaigns did not yield a proportionally higher profitability.
* **Core Campaign Focus:** Across both periods, the highest ROMI values were consistently achieved by the same campaigns: **"Trendy," "Promos," and "Lookalike."** The majority of successful results stem from these three core campaigns.

***Recommendation:*** Future budgeting strategies should focus on concentrating expenditure heavily on these three high-performing campaigns to ensure the expected profit increase is realized from budget growth.
