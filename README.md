## 💾 Data Source

A non-public dataset provided by the institution where I received my training was utilized. This dataset includes metrics such as ad spend, revenue, and core performance indicators.

## 🔑 Key Findings

The analysis includes comparisons of campaign performance based on total spend, total revenue, CPC (Cost Per Click), CPM (Cost Per Mille/Thousand), CTR (Click-Through Rate), and **ROMI (Return on Marketing Investment)** across monthly and yearly periods.

According to the performance evaluation:

* **The campaign with the highest ROMI value was identified as "Trendy."**
* [You can add your other findings here. For example: "Google campaigns showed a X% higher CTR compared to Facebook campaigns."]
